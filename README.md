🎓 Automated Internship & Project Portal for Colleges

A centralized web platform that streamlines internship and academic project management within colleges. It enables students to discover, apply, and track verified opportunities while allowing faculty and companies to post, manage, and monitor projects in a secure, college-controlled ecosystem.

📌 Problem Statement

Colleges often manage internships and academic projects through fragmented and manual processes such as notices, spreadsheets, and messaging apps. This leads to poor visibility, lack of tracking, mismatched opportunities, and high administrative overhead for students, faculty, and companies.

💡 Solution Overview

This platform automates the complete internship and project lifecycle by integrating academics, skills, and opportunity management. It provides intelligent recommendations and readiness insights to help students find the right opportunities while simplifying evaluation and monitoring for faculty and recruiters.
