# 🎓 Automated Internship & Project Portal for Colleges

A centralized **AI-powered internship management platform** designed to connect **students, companies, and college administrators** in a single, controlled ecosystem.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Colleges currently manage internships and academic projects through fragmented systems such as notices, spreadsheets, and informal communication.  
This results in **poor visibility**, **manual approvals**, **inefficient tracking**, and **limited personalization** for students.

## 🤖 AI-Driven Core Idea

Artificial Intelligence is deeply integrated to enhance the internship experience:

- **AI Skill Analysis** – evaluates student profiles against market demand  
- **AI Match Score** – ranks internships based on student skills  
- **AI Readiness Score** – indicates student preparedness for internships  
- **Smart Recommendations** – suggests relevant internships dynamically  
- **Data-Driven Dashboards** – visual insights for students and admins  

> The system focuses on **quality matching**, not mass applications.
